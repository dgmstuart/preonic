# dgms Preonic layout

This is my personal layout for the Preonic keyboard from
[OLKB](https://olkb.com/).

I built it using the
[QMK configurator](https://config.qmk.fm/#/preonic/LAYOUT_ortho_5x12)
based on the default layout.

## My board

I have the OLKB-60 model, which I bought through
[Massdrop](https://www.massdrop.com/buy/preonic-mechanical-keyboard) in the
drop which shipped in February 2018.
It uses revision 2 of the firmware.

The keycaps are the XDA
[Canvas](https://mitormk.com/canvas/)
Betas with icon modifiers. These were part of the same drop. Supposedly there
were issues with the printing of those caps, so they rereleased a fixed set,
but I prefer the original, chunkier lines so I kept those.
